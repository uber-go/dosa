## Abstract

[dosa][dosa-spec] is a library that provides a distributed
object storage abstraction for applications in golang and
java. It's designed to help with storage discovery and
abstract the underlying database system.

If you'd like to start by writing a small DOSA-enabled
program, check out [the guide][guide/DOSA.md].

## Overview

DOSA is a storage library that supports:

 * methods to store and retrieve go structs
 * struct annotations to describe queries against data
 * tools to create and/or migrate database schemas
 * implementations that serialize requests to remote stateless servers
