#!/bin/bash
#
# Utility script for building CLI tarballs for a given release.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/build_cli.sh <tag>
#
# Arguments:
#   tag (required) - Release tag (eg. v2.1.2).
#
# Example:
#   $ ./scripts/build_cli.sh v2.1.2
#
# Description:
#
#   Two tarballs will be created for the CLI, one for
#   Darwin (OSX) and the other for Linux. Both binaries are built using
#   the `cli` Make target which will automatically bake the tag, commit SHA
#   and timestamp into the associated binary. The resulting packages will
#   can be found ./out/dosa-{darwin,linux}-{tag}.tar.gz.
