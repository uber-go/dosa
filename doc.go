// Package dosa is the DOSA - Declarative Object Storage Abstraction.
//
// Abstract
//
// DOSA open source is not ready for prime time yet. We will announce when it's ready.
//
// [dosa] is a library that provides a distributed
// object storage abstraction for applications in golang and
// java. It's designed to help with storage discovery and
// abstract the underlying database system.
//
//
// If you'd like to start by writing a small DOSA-enabled
// program, check out [the guide][guide/DOSA.md].
//
//
// Overview
//
// DOSA is a storage library that supports:
//
// • methods to store and retrieve go structs
//
// • struct annotations to describe queries against data
//
// • tools to create and/or migrate database schemas
//
// • implementations that serialize requests to remote stateless servers
